# Project MySQL All For One 

This project was developed while I was studying SQL at Trybe Programming School.

Skills I needed for this project:

 - Finding data in an SQL database;

 - Filter data specifically;

 - Manipulate tables;

At the root of the project, there are files called desafioN.sql, each N equals the number of the challenge I performed.

1. Download the northwind.sql file and select "Save" to save the file to your computer.

2. Open the file with some text editor and select the entire contents of the file using `CTRL-A`.

3. Open the MySQL Workbench.

4. Open a new query window and paste the entire contents of the `northwind.sql` file into it.

5. Select all the code with the shortcut `CTRL-A` and then click on the lightning icon to run the query.

6. Wait a few seconds (wait around 30 seconds before trying to do something).

7. Click the MySQL Workbench button to refresh the database listing.

8. Verify that the restored database has all of the following tables:

    alt="tables" height="300" style="border-radius:50px;">


9. Right click on each table and select "Select Rows" and make sure all tables have records. If any are missing, proceed with the next step. Otherwise, you can copy each SQL command from the desafioN.sql files and see what they do.

10. If there are tables missing, drop the database by right-clicking on the northwind database and selecting "Drop Schema" and redo the steps again, this time waiting for a longer time when running the restore script.
